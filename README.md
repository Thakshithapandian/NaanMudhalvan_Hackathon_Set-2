ONLINE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM

This online food ordering system manages restaurants, menu items, customers, and orders using a MySQL database. It enables users to browse menus, place orders, and track delivery status while generating sales reports per restaurant. The system ensures efficient order processing with structured data relationships. Future improvements include multi-item orders and automated status updates.
